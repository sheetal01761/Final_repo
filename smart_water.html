          <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;"><u>Introduction</u> :- </h4>
          <p>1.  In this system, based on the soil type, the water will be provided to the agricultural field. In agriculture, there are two things, namely, the moisture content of the soil as well as the fertility of the soil. At the present time, there are several types of techniques available for irrigation to reduce the need for rain. This type of technique is driven by on/off schedule using electrical power. This article discusses the implementation of a smart irrigation system using IoT.<br><br>
2.  It will not only automatically irrigate the water based on the moisture level in the soil but also send the Data to ThingSpeak Server to keep track of the land condition. The System will consist a water pump which will be used to sprinkle water on the land depending upon the land environmental condition such as Moisture, Temperature and Humidity.
 </p>
        
             <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;"><u>Work Specification :- </u> :- </h4>
             <p>In this project, we had commanded the arduino/328p microcontroller through a webpage to control the motor (i.e., to start and stop the motor) and the rest of whole irrigation process will be automatically controlled by arduino itself.<br>
The only thing that the need to do is to –Start the motor or if he desires it can switch off the motor by just a click only.
<br>

             <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;"><u> Future Implementations</u> </h4>
             
             <p>Also, further this proposed system can be enhanced by adding up machine learning algorithms, which are capable to study and recognize the necessities of the crop, this would aid the agriculture field to be an automatic system. The inspections and outcomes tell us that this result can be executed for a lessening of water loss and decrease the manpower necessary for a field.</p>

               <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;"><u>Conclusion</u> :- </h4>
               <p>​The “smart water irrigation system  can be of great a advantage to thefarmers as it is cheap and small too. It can also develop a lot with the coming future as this product is both  promising and easier with innovative technologies.</p>

             <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;"><u></u> Technology Stack:- </h4>
             <p><li> In the agriculture field, sensors are used like soil moisture. The information received from the sensors is sent to the Database folder through the Android device.</li><br> 
             <li> In the control section, the system is activated using the application, this is finished using the ON/OFF buttons in the application.</li><br>
             <li> Also, this system is automatically activated when the soil moisture is low, the pump is switched ON based on the moisture content.</li><br>
<li>The application has a feature like taking some time from the user and water the agriculture field when the time comes. There's a switch used to turn off the water supply if the system fails. Other parameters such as the moisture sensor demonstrate the threshold price and the level of water in the soil.</li><br>
<li> Also, this project can be incorporated to make sure the value of the soil and the expansion of harvest in each soil. The microcontroller and sensors are successfully interfaced and wireless communication is attained between a variety of nodes.</li><br>
 </p>

               <h4 style="color:dodgerblue;"><u></u> WORKING:- </h4>
               <p>
Once the Motor pump has started- following automated condition will work:<br>
1.  User can switch OFF the motor if he desires by a click on the web page.<br>
2.  The motor pump will automatically get switched OFF once the soil moisture sensor has reached the required threshold value.<br>
3.  If weather condition is such that it started raining, then the micro-controller will shut down the motor pump till raining. And after that it checks whether the soil moisture sensor has reached the threshold value or not. If it crosses the threshold value then motor pump will remain shut down otherwise it will start again automatically. This helps in saving water resource and electricity.<br>
4.  Also in case, when power supply gets cut-off and motor gets switched off. It will restart again automatically when there will be availability power supply, user will have not to worry about restarting the motor pump manually.<br>
5.  Also data of various sensor like- moisture sensor , temperature sensor, humidity sensor will be displayed on BOLT cloud in graphical form.
